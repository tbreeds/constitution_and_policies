## Rationale
One of Linux Australia's goals is to provide members of our community with forums for discussion of Free and Open Source technologies. To facilitate these events, Linux Australia provides a legal structure, and administrative services on behalf of our community.

Linux Australia forms conference and event subcommittees in order to delegate responsibility for the organisation of individual conferences and events to enthusiastic and responsible members of our community. This includes delegating access to funds and bank accounts, and delegating authority to contract venues and suppliers for events.

Linux Australia supports enthusiastic community members in organising conferences and other events, by delegating them with the legal ability to act in Linux Australia's name, including delegating access to funds and bank accounts, and the authority to contract venues and suppliers for events. Linux Australia delegates this authority by forming conference subcommittees.

This subcommittee policy exists to ensure that conferences are run effectively, and to minimise risks and liabilities to both Linux Australia and the conference team. It ensures that Linux Australia has oversight of our events, that our community is aware of the progress of events, and ensures that our events are run to a high standard.

This policy replaces Linux Australia's former subcommittee policy for events, which involved appointing a subcommittee for each instance of each conference. This previously left open the question of conference selection and succession of conference teams.

Linux Australia also has the following requirements for conference subcommittees that need to be addressed:

* More frequent reporting of conference activities
* Greater oversight of budgeting and expenditure of conference funds
* More frequent reporting of the financial state of the conference to council
* Increasing due diligence for conference selection

The intention of this policy is to ensure that reporting is not arduous, but substantially increases Council's awareness of how a conference is progressing. It also nominates specific avenues for conference organisers to seek advice.

NOTE - Reference to â€˜Conference' in this Agreement relates to GovHack Australia

## Structure
Subcommittees are created by the Linux Australia Council, and each subcommittee will continue to exist at the discretion of the Council. Subcommittee members serve at the discretion of the council.

Each conference will have a single, long-standing subcommittee, which may be called a Steering subcommittee. In future, Steering subcommittees will be formed instead of the short-standing subcommittees for each instance of the conference.

A steering subcommittee consists of representatives of the team hosting the current rotation of the conference (the "site team"), and trusted representatives of the community.

Steering subcommittees consist of at least five voting members, and any number of non-voting members, known as observers.

The voting members are divided into two categories: site team representatives and community representatives. This is to ensure that community members, with the long-term interest of the conference, balance those who are more interested in the success of the current instance of the conference. All voting members must be members of Linux Australia.

![Diagram of example subcommittee](https://github.com/linuxaustralia/constitution_and_policies/raw/master/subcommittee_diagram.png)

Steering subcommittees must appoint a minimum of two community representatives. However, if only a single or no community representatives can be appointed, council shall act as the remaining community representatives for the purposes of voting and quorum.

The number of community representatives shall be weighted appropriately compared with the number of site representatives, subject to approval by council.

Steering subcommittees may also appoint any number of observers as they see fit.

At least the following roles should be in place:

### Site Chair (Conference Director; President of the Steering subcommittee)
The lead organiser of the conference, and presides over any meeting of the subcommittee. Is directly responsible for the forthcoming instance of the conference.

### Treasurer
A member of the site team. Is responsible for preparing conference budgets for consideration by the subcommittee. Prepares invoices for debtors. Prepares payments from the conference bank account for approval, and is responsible for ensuring conference debts are paid on time.

### Community Representatives
Advises the subcommittee on decisions, and acts as a guiding influence to the remainder of the subcommittee. Ensures that financial decisions made by the site team have the long-term interest of the conference and LA in mind. Should be appointed from past organisers of the conference, or from trusted members of the community. 

### Bank Account Managers
The subcommittee should appoint at least two voting members with the ability to sign payments to the conference bank account: one must be the subcommittee treasurer. 

### Other Roles
Steering subcommittees may at their discretion define other formal roles, which may be fulfilled either by voting members of the subcommittee, or by observers.

### Observers
Perform roles defined by the subcommittee, and are appointed by a method the subcommittee sees fit. Observers are members of a steering subcommittee, report to meetings of the subcommittee, and may request motions be put to vote, but do not have voting powers for the purposes of reporting to Council.

Observers may, at the discretion of the subcommittee, have formally defined roles for the purposes of the conference.

## Role of the Subcommittee
Subcommittees will perform at least the following tasks, to ensure that their conference runs successfully, is handed over, and reports their financial situation to the council.

### Nomination of Community Representatives
* Community representatives shall be nominated by the membership, or by the Linux Australia council.
* Community representatives shall be appointed by council from nominees.
* Community representatives shall serve for terms of one year, commencing from the conclusion of one conference, to the conclusion of the following year's conference.
* Community representatives may be appointed for further terms as council sees fit.
